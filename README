AES-128 implementation.

Author: Ravi Malik

Why this library exists?

The sole intention of creating this AES-128 library was learning. I was making some projects which required the use of block ciphers. And AES is the best block cipher that i came across. And i knew that there are implementations of AES available on the internet which are both super optimised and highly secure. But i decided to write my own because i wish to learn rather than using some ready made tool infront of me. In future this library would grow into an optimised and secure one. Many issues would arise which i will fix and others will help me fix and learn alongside as there would arise many situations which would test one's skills. And eventually this will rise up as an efficient implementation. 

Happy Learning :D

Information about various files:

1. aes.h : This contains the implementation code of the AES-128 algorithm. The only part which is not involved in it is the MixColumnOperation.
2. MixColumn.h : Implementation of the Rijndael MixColumn Operation.
3. MixColumnData.h : It contains the raw data required by the MixColumn.h file.
4. test.c : It contains a small testing program to test if the AES-128 implementation is functioning correct.
